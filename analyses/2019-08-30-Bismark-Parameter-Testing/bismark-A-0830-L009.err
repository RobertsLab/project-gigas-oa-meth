Path to Bowtie 2 specified as: bowtie2
Bowtie seems to be working fine (tested command 'bowtie2 --version' [2.3.0])
Output format is BAM (default)
Did not find Samtools on the system. Alignments will be compressed with GZIP instead (.sam.gz)
Reference genome folder provided is Crassostrea_gigas.oyster_v9.dna_sm.toplevel/	(absolute path is '/Users/yaamini/Documents/project-gigas-oa-meth/analyses/2019-08-30-Bismark-Parameter-Testing/Crassostrea_gigas.oyster_v9.dna_sm.toplevel/)'
Processing sequences up to read no. 10000 from the input file

Input files to be analysed (in current folder '/Users/yaamini/Documents/project-gigas-oa-meth/analyses/2019-08-30-Bismark-Parameter-Testing'):
YRVA_R1_001.fastq.gz
YRVA_R2_001.fastq.gz
Library was specified to be not strand-specific (non-directional), therefore alignments to all four possible bisulfite strands (OT, CTOT, OB and CTOB) will be reported
Setting parallelization to single-threaded (default)

Current working directory is: /Users/yaamini/Documents/project-gigas-oa-meth/analyses/2019-08-30-Bismark-Parameter-Testing

Now reading in and storing sequence information of the genome specified in: /Users/yaamini/Documents/project-gigas-oa-meth/analyses/2019-08-30-Bismark-Parameter-Testing/Crassostrea_gigas.oyster_v9.dna_sm.toplevel/

Single-core mode: setting pid to 1

Paired-end alignments will be performed
=======================================

The provided filenames for paired-end alignments are YRVA_R1_001.fastq.gz and YRVA_R2_001.fastq.gz
Input files are in FastQ format
